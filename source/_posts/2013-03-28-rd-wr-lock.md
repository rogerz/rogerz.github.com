Read write lock is used to **share** reading access to resources while locking it for **exclusive** writing access. Here are two implementation described by pseudo code.

# A simple implementation

```
init
  create sem(max readers)
  create mutex
lock read ()
  take sem
unlock read
  put sem
lock write
  get mutex
  get sem for max readers times
unlock write
  put sem for max readers times
  put mutex
```

There is a limit on maximum readers and it is not very efficient when locking and unlocking write.

# Another implementaion

From [pthreads](https://github.com/RT-Thread/rt-thread/blob/master/components/pthreads/pthread_rwlock.c) component in RT-Thread 

```
wrlock
  if ref_count ！= 0  // locked by rd or wr
    wait in condwriters
  ref_count = -1

rdlock
  if ref_count = -1 // locked by wr
    wait in condreaders
  ref_count++

unlock // for both wrlock and rdlock
  if ref_count > 0
    ref_count--  // release reader
  if ref_count = -1
    ref_count = 0 // release writer
  if writers > 0
    if ref_count == 0 // no more readers
      signal next writer
  else 
    if readers > 0  // no more writers
        broadcast readers
```

If you are reading the real code, be careful not being mislead by the `rw_mutex`. It is used to protect the access to `rw_lock` object itself not the target resource.

For the real resource, it checks the `ref_count` for access permission. `ref_count` is 0 if the resource is free, -1 if locked by at least one writer, positive if shared by several readers.

`condwriters` and `condreaders` are actually `semaphore`, "signal writer" is actually putting the `semaphore`. "broadcast readers" is quite tricky. It **tries** to take the `semaphore` and then release it **no matter** you got it or not. Stop the try once you get it successfully. Suppose there are some threads waiting on the `semaphore`. It works as following.

```
try take sem and fail
release sem and wake up one thread
try take sem and fails
release sem and wake next thread
try take sem and fails
release sem but no thread to wake
try take sem and success
stop
```
