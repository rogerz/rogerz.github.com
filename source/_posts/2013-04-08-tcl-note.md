In order to customize [source navigator NG][1], I have to push myself to learn a new language [Tcl][2].

The most interesting thing I've learned in the first day is the substitution.

*   __dollar sign $__ will substitute a variable name with its value
*   __square braces []__ will substitute the content with the return value of the enclosed command. 
    Note that _puts_ returns an empty result instead of its output. _set_ will return the assigned value. It is probably what you need for testing this feature
*   __quotes ""__ will trigger the evaluation of every $ and [] inside it. The result is like a constant. It keeps the value of the first time it is evaluated. Special attention should be paid when it is used in loop condition
*   __braces {}__ will prevent $ and [] substitution until it is evaluated by _expr_ or _if_/_while_/... context

However, the braces seems have other usage such as enclosing a group of command just like the C language, using in the _for_ loop. This really disappointed me. I once thought there could be a unique explanation. But I failed to figure it out.
