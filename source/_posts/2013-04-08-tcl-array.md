The __array__ in tcl is so special that it may look odd at first. When we say array in tcl, it is the associative array not the general speaking C array which in tcl has the name __list__ instead.

Parentheses are used for the index of array. For example:

    set myarray(name) "array name"
    puts "name of myarray is $myarray(name)"

This is nothing special. But the fact that _array is just a collection of variable and does not have a value_ is not easy to understand. It is not the same concept as the pointer in C language. When you pass an array to a tcl command i.e. proc or function, whatever the name is, you have to use a special way to get "its value", more precisely the values of the variables in the array.

    proc print12 {array} {
       upvar $array a
       puts "$a(1), $a(2)"
    }

Here, __upvar__ creates a local alias for the upper level name.

So array in tcl is more like a quick naming scope. You get a variable "name" inside "myarray" in the previous example.
